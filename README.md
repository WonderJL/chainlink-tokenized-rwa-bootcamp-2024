# Tokenized RWA Bootcamp 2024

Welcome to the **Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) Bootcamp 2024**! This repository contains resources and links to guide you through the bootcamp sessions, focusing on tokenizing real-world assets using blockchain technology.

## Overview

This bootcamp is designed to provide hands-on experience with tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) on blockchain networks. Throughout the sessions, you'll learn how to leverage blockchain technologies like Chainlink to bring real-world assets on-chain and explore the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).

All the resources, code, and links related to the bootcamp are available here, with supporting documentation accessible via GitBook.
